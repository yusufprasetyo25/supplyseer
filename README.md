# <div align="center"> SupplySeer </div>
Welcome to version 0.2 (pre-release alpha)!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pre-release Software Notice**: This library is currently in pre-release alpha (v0.2). The repo may undergo significant changes before the 1.0.0 release. While the statistical implementations are sound, we recommend testing thoroughly before using in production environments.

`supplyseer` is a Python library focused on providing the tools and methods for real-world Supply Chain & Logistics challenges. <br>
<br>
You'll find Bayesian Economic Order Quantity (dynamical stochastic EOQ), Probabilistic Bayesian Networks, Neural Networks, <br>
Principal Component Analaysis, time series models like ARIMA, and evaluation metrics for models and for information content. <br>
<br>
Supplyseer provides Permutation Complexity as a metric for time series analysis but also Manipulability Index and Hurst Exponent and many more.
<br>
<br>
**Check Tutorials section for guides and examples!**

## <div align="center"> Installation </div>

You can install `supplyseer` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install supplyseer==0.2.2
```

## <div align="center"> Optimization </div>
This library also supports basic optimization with Google's `ortools`. See below example for a Truck Driver scheduling problem.

  </p>

  [Truck Driver Scheduling problem](https://github.com/supplyseer-ai/supplyseer/blob/develop/examples/truck-driver-routing.ipynb) - You have some truck drivers that you need to schedule for over a time window of 3 days with 3 shifts. Morning, afternoon, and evening. If they had the evening shift they cannot have the morning shift the day after because they need to rest. Also, they have to deliver at least 2 shifts during the 3 day window. <br>
  <br>
  Problem: Schedule truck drivers over a 3-day window with multiple constraints: <br>
    
    * Three shifts per day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
    * Rest period required between evening and next morning shift
    * Minimum 2 shifts per driver over 3 days
    
  <br>
  
 [Demand & Inventory Control](https://github.com/supplyseer-ai/supplyseer/blob/develop/examples/demand-inventory-control.ipynb) - A Supply Chain department for a retail company needs to balance their inventory and demand such that there is also enough inventory to match the demand but the inventory is not allowed to go below a certain level nor above a certain level. <br>
 <br>
 Problem: Optimize inventory levels while,

    * Meeting demand requirements
    * Maintaining minimum safety stock
    * Respecting maximum storage capacity
