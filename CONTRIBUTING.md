# Welcome to SupplySeer! 🚚

Hey there! Thanks for your interest in making SupplySeer even better. Whether you're optimizing an algorithm, adding a new supply chain metric, or fixing a bug, we're excited to have you here!

## How We Build Together 🛠️

### First Time Contributing?

Awesome! Here's how to get started:

1. **Install SupplySeer**
```bash
pip install supplyseer
```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supplyseer.git
cd supplyseer

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov black isort mypy pre-commit ortools
pre-commit install

# Install package in editable mode for development
pip install -e .
```

### Making Changes 📝

1. **Create a Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature
```

2. **Write Some Code**
- Add your awesome changes
- Write tests for your new code
- Make sure existing tests still pass
- Update docs if needed

3. **Commit Your Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add some awesome feature"
```

4. **Push & Create a Pull Request**
```bash
git push origin your-feature
```
Then head to GitHub and create a Pull Request!

## Types of Contributions 🌟

### Code Philosophy
- Be OOP oriented
- Be modular
- Don't put all code in one module if it becomes complex
- Tests helps us remove the burden of reviews on each other and keeps the code robust

### 🐛 Found a Bug?
- Check if it's already reported in Issues
- If not, create a new issue with a clear description
- Better yet: Submit a pull request with a fix!

### 💡 Have an Idea?
- Share it in Issues!
- Let's discuss how to make it happen
- Ideas particularly welcome for:
  - Game theoretic applications in supply chains
  - New supply chain metrics
  - Optimization algorithms
  - Inventory management models
  - Time series analysis tools

### 📚 Documentation
- Found something confusing?
- Have a good supply chain example to share?
- Documentation improvements are always welcome!

## Best Practices 🎯

### Code Style
- We use Black for formatting
- Type hints are required
- Clear variable names make everyone happy
- Comments explain the "why", code shows the "how"

### Tests
- Write tests for new features
- Run `pytest` to check everything works
- Include supply chain specific test cases
- Add examples that can be used in documentation

### Documentation
- Update docstrings with NumPy style
- Add practical examples from supply chain
- Include mathematical notation when needed
- Document assumptions and limitations

## Supply Chain & Game Theory Contributions 📦🎲

When adding new methods:
- Reference academic papers/books if applicable
- Explain the business context and use case
- Add examples with known results
- Include edge cases in tests
- Document assumptions clearly
- Consider computational efficiency
- Add real-world applicability notes

Key areas of focus:
- Cooperative game theory applications
- Coalition formation algorithms
- Shapley value computations
- Inventory optimization
- Demand forecasting
- Route optimization
- Supply chain network design
- Risk analysis
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning applications
